    Good Morning, Respected Teachers,

We group of class 10 section D presenting  a working model based on the chapter "Applications of Trigonometry."

In this chapter, we explored important concepts such as the line of sight, angle of elevation, angle of depression, and the horizontal plane at the observer's level. Today, we'll be demonstrating how the angle of elevation works using a laser model to clearly illustrate the relationship between the line of sight and the horizontal line.

Case 1:
In the first scenario, the angle of elevation is 45째, and the distance between the observer and the object is 12 meters. Since the value of tan 45째 is 1, the height of the object (or building) will also be 12 meters.

Case 2:
In the second scenario, the angle of elevation is 60째, and the distance from the observer is 10 meters. Using the trigonometric value of tan 60째, which is approximately 1.73, the height of the building comes out to be around 17.3 meters.

Thank you for your time and attention as we showcase our project.
